# HANDOFF

Last updated: 2026-11-14, session 4 (M3 merged; M4 approved and started), on the owner's personal machine. Tools
are installed system-wide with Homebrew (`docs/context/environment.md`).

## Where we are

- **M3 Specify: done and merged** (PRs #60–#76, 2026-11-12; `main` CI green at `9339c36`). Exit
  criteria met: 9/9 eval runs valid, blast recall 100% (`docs/plans/M3-report.md`).
- **M0 Skeleton, M1 Guardrails, M2 Understand: done and merged into `main`.**
  - M0 and M1: PRs #1–#42.
  - M2: PRs #43–#58, merged 2026-11-10 in order with merge commits; `main` CI green at
    `ec12150`.
  - The owner accepted M2 with a measured shortfall (`docs/plans/M2-report.md` §7).
- **AI eval target still open: `docs/plans/EVALS.md`.**
  - The confidence-label target is 100%; it measured 85.7–90.5%.
  - Traps: 29/30 against 30/30.
  - The owner: "We won't let it go." Re-run per `EVALS.md` §When to run again, with the
    owner's go-ahead (each run costs about $13).

## Exact next step

M4 Build is **approved** (2026-11-14, `docs/plans/M4-plan.md`, with Q1–Q4 answered: budget OK,
PostgreSQL yes, `govulncheck` limited to `vuln.go.dev`, and the live GitHub check and dogfooding
yes in principle, asked again before each). It is built as stacked PRs, one per task of
M4-plan §9:

| Task | Branch | PR | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| plan | `docs/m4-plan` | #77 (base main) | open |
| 00a buildable Go fixture repos | `feat/m4-fixture-build` | #78 | open, gate green |
| 00b fake GitHub PR store and call log | `feat/m4-fixture-prs` | #79 | open, gate green |
| 01 worktrees, `change@4`, `OwnBranches` | `feat/m4-worktrees` | #80 | open, gate green |
| 02 git preflight, overlap card, `building` guard | `feat/m4-preflight` | #81 | open, gate green |
| 03 commit, branch and title lint; pre-commit checks | `feat/m4-git-lint` | #82 | open, gate green |
| 04a `athel git push` | `feat/m4-push-pr` | #83 | open, gate green |
| 04b `athel pr body|open|update`, ADR 026 | `feat/m4-pr` | #84 | open, gate green (`pr ready` moves to task 10) |
| 05 gates: defaults, classifier-checked runner (ADR 023), baseline, flaky, evidence | `feat/m4-gates` | #85 | open, gate green |
| 06a changed-lines coverage and complexity gates (ADR 025) | `feat/m4-gates-quality` | #86 | open, gate green |
| 06b contract and `ac-tests` gates, per-repo `gates.yaml` overrides | `feat/m4-gates-contract` | — | **next** |
| 07–17 | see M4-plan §9 | — | not started |

Next:
1. **Task 06b** on `feat/m4-gates-contract`, branched from `feat/m4-gates-quality`:
   - **contract** (full stage, never waivable): M3's `blast diff` gives the change surface of
     the task's diff; `blast check` compares it with the planned report. Changes not in the
     plan fail;
   - **`ac-tests`** (cheap stage, never waivable): every AC the task covers
     (`plan.yaml covers`) appears in at least one changed test file's text (FR-BUILD-003);
   - per-repo overrides in `.athel/config/gates.yaml` (new `gates@1` schema: replace a
     gate's command, or add a gate). The policy rules apply: a replaced command still passes
     ADR 023's check.

   Watch out: the `cli` package is at 90.5%, so every new command needs its error paths
   tested. A gate run is about 10 s per test.
2. Continue the tasks in order, each its own PR stacked on the previous one.
3. Paid evals only with the owner's go-ahead each time, smoke runs first.

## Open questions for the owner

- M3 plan review, Q1 and Q2 (M3-plan §11). Each eval run needs a go-ahead (cost).

## Owner instructions given in chat (all also in docs/context/decisions-from-chat.md)

- 2026-11-02: On the personal PC, no `./.tools` or `scripts/env.sh`; Claude installs the tools
  with Homebrew. The handoff prompt was rewritten and committed straight to `main` on the
  owner's explicit instruction ("just fucking commit on main"). The borrowed machine was then
  cleaned up: the gh login was removed and the local clone deleted.

- 2026-11-02: "next phases of implementation i'll do on my personal PC … wrap up the work here,
  and write proper documentation … proper handoff … how to continue … commit and push
  everything on this machine and then destroy everything of mine - gh account linked on this,
  the repo, but not before my confirmation".
- 2026-11-09: tools via Homebrew (approved); gh account vs-snabbit (owner's choice, against the
  recommendation to log in as mr-vaibh); vs-snabbit added as a collaborator; keep the merged
  M0/M1 branches. The owner asked for the work to be done "properly … production enterprise
  level … accurate and precise".
