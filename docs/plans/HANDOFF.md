# HANDOFF

Last updated: 2026-11-10, session 4 (M2 merged), on the owner's personal machine. Tools
are installed system-wide with Homebrew (`docs/context/environment.md`).

## Where we are

- **M0 Skeleton, M1 Guardrails, M2 Understand: done and merged into `main`.**
  - M0 and M1: PRs #1–#42.
  - M2: PRs #43–#58, merged 2026-11-10 in order with merge commits; `main` CI green at
    `ec12150`.
  - The owner accepted M2 with a measured shortfall (`docs/plans/M2-report.md` §7).
- **AI eval target still open: `docs/plans/EVALS.md`.**
  - The confidence-label target is 100%; it measured 85.7–90.5%.
  - Traps: 29/30 against 30/30.
  - The owner: "We won't let it go." Re-run per `EVALS.md` §When to run again, with the
    owner's go-ahead (each run costs about $13).

## Exact next step

1. Merge the scoreboard PR (`docs/eval-scoreboard`): `EVALS.md` plus links.
2. Start M3 Phase 1, planning (doc 08 M3 row; `ROADMAP.md` §M3):
   - read the M3 spec sections, write `docs/plans/M3-plan.md` with open questions and
     recommendations, and stop for the owner's approval;
   - include an `EVALS.md` improvement (items 1–3) as an early M3 task, followed by an eval run
     with the owner's go-ahead.

## Open questions for the owner

- None open. Each future eval run needs a go-ahead (cost).

## Owner instructions given in chat (all also in docs/context/decisions-from-chat.md)

- 2026-11-02: On the personal PC, no `./.tools` or `scripts/env.sh`; Claude installs the tools
  with Homebrew. The handoff prompt was rewritten and committed straight to `main` on the
  owner's explicit instruction ("just fucking commit on main"). The borrowed machine was then
  cleaned up: the gh login was removed and the local clone deleted.

- 2026-11-02: "next phases of implementation i'll do on my personal PC … wrap up the work here,
  and write proper documentation … proper handoff … how to continue … commit and push
  everything on this machine and then destroy everything of mine - gh account linked on this,
  the repo, but not before my confirmation".
- 2026-11-09: tools via Homebrew (approved); gh account vs-snabbit (owner's choice, against the
  recommendation to log in as mr-vaibh); vs-snabbit added as a collaborator; keep the merged
  M0/M1 branches. The owner asked for the work to be done "properly … production enterprise
  level … accurate and precise".
